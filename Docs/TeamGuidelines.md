# Team Guidelines

## Making changes using branches

#### Initial Setup
* Initially clone the repo
* cd into the new directory

#### Pushing and pulling
1. Create a branch (git checkout -b < branch name >)
2. Check that you are in the correct branch, not the main branch (git branch)
3. Write your tests and then your code
4. Stage your changes (git add)
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message (git commit -m "message")
6. Push your changes into the repo (git push --set-upstream origin < branch name >)

* Creating a pull request.
