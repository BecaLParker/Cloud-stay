# Team Guidelines

## Making changes using branches

* Initially clone the repo
* cd into the new directory
* Create a branch (git checkout -b < branch name >)
* Check that you are in the correct branch, not the main branch (git branch)
* Write your tests and then your code
* Stage your changes (git add)
* Commit your changes with a descriptive message (git commit -m "meesage")
* Push your changes into the repo (git push --set-upstream origin < branch name >)

* Creating a pull request.
